- 👋 Hi, I’m @theendlesswave!
- 👀 I’m interested in building stuff!  Recently, I did some ML stuff with python and jupyter notebook. I built a predictor for a connect 4 challenge and I won!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more ML with Andrew Ng's coursera course.  I am also learning more Typescript with Node js.  Also studying blockchain work with solidity. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more ML projects.
